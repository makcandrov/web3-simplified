# web3-simplified | An easier way to use web3

This is a package that wraps the packages `web3js` and `solc`  and that provides more user-friendly functions to interact with the blockchain of your choice. Not all the functions from these packages are redefined, but the most common interractions are largely simplified. If you would like to do a more complex interaction that has not been redefined, you still can access to all the functions provided by `web3js` and `solc`.

## Installation

### Node

```bash
npm install web3-simplified
```
